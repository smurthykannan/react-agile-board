# React + Vite + Yarn

This is a starter project built with [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/).

## Features

- **Fast Development**: Built with Vite for lightning-fast Hot Module Replacement (HMR).
- **Modern JavaScript**: Supports the latest JavaScript features (ES6+) out of the box.
- **React**: A popular UI library for building user interfaces.
- **Yarn**: Fast, reliable, and secure dependency management.
  
## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16.x or higher)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) (v1.22 or higher)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/smurthykannan/react-agile-board.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    cd your-repo-name

3. Install dependencies:
    yarn install

4. Start the development server:
    yarn dev

This will start the Vite development server. The project should now be running at http://localhost:3000 by default.

Available Scripts
Here are the scripts you can run in the project:

    yarn dev: Starts the Vite development server.   
    yarn build: Builds the app for production.
    yarn preview: Serves the production build locally.
    yarn lint: Lints the codebase for style issues using ESLint.
    yarn test: Runs unit tests (if configured).

Project Structure
The folder structure of the project is as follows:
├── public             # Static files
├── src
│   ├── assets         # Static assets (images, fonts, etc.)
│   ├── components     # Reusable React components
│   ├── pages          # Page-level components
│   ├── App.jsx        # Main app component

└── yarn.lock          # Dependency lock file

Building for Production
    To build the project for production, run:
        yarn build

    This will create an optimized build of your React app in the dist directory. You can then serve it with any static site hosting service.

Deployment
    You can deploy the contents of the dist folder to a web server or static site host like Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages.
